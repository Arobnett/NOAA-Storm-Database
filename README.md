# NOAA-Storm-Database
In this analysis, we explore the NOAA Storm Database to gain insights into severe weather events in the United States. The primary goal is to answer two key questions: (1) Which types of events are most harmful to population health? and (2) Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences? By examining the database, we aim to provide valuable information for government and municipal managers responsible for preparing for severe weather events and prioritizing resources. The analysis follows a structured approach, starting with data processing, including loading and cleaning the raw data. We then present the results through visualizations and statistical summaries. The analysis showcases the types of events that pose the highest risk to population health and identifies the events that have the most significant economic impacts. By understanding these patterns, decision-makers can allocate resources efficiently and effectively mitigate the adverse effects of severe weather events.
